# Quantum-compiler
A quantum compiler implementation of PCOAST (Pauli-based Quantum Circuit Optimization Framework) in Python.

## Note
Not everthing is implemented yet. The following is a list of what is implemented and what is not.

### Implemented

### Limitation
- [Debugging graph] when showing a debugging graph for a specific circuit, some nodes may not show in the correct order.
- [Optimization] the optimization algorithm is not implemented yet.
